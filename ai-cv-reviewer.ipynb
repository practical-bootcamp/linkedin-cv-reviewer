    "1. The resume **must** incorporate an email and mobile number for communication purposes. Issue a warning if these details are absent.\n",
    "2. The profile section **must** include the student's name, course name, school, and GitHub URL. If any of these components are absent, issue a warning.\n",
    "3. Students are expected to be enrolled in the **Higher Diploma in Cloud and Data Centre Administration** course in Hong Kong. Issue a warning if this information is absent or incorrect.\n",
    "4. Stay alert for any nonsensical content (excluding Irrelevant/non-IT working Experience) or spelling errors. Issue a warning and highlight the mistakes if any are found.\n",
    "5. The summary section should not contain any pronouns.\n",
    "6. Ensure the use of tenses is consistent throughout the resume.\n",
    "7. Based on the resume content, propose an appropriate job title for the student.\n",
    "8. Assign a \"Resume Rating\" on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 represents an exceptional resume.\n",
    "9. If there are any warnings or missing information, the \"Resume Rating\" **must not** surpass 5.\n",
    "10. Adopt the perspective of an IT interviewer and provide a rationale for the \"Resume Rating\", linking it to the probability of landing a job.\n",
    "11. Based on the resume content, suggest the type of job the student is likely to secure, such as a Cloud Engineer, Data Centre Technician, or Network Engineer.\n",
